\section{Alternative points prescriptions}
In Sec.~\ref{sec:scale_var} we construct the theory covariance matrix using the so-called 9-points prescription, 
where the renormalization and factorization scales of a specific process are varied completely independently.
In Ref.~\cite{AbdulKhalek:2019ihb} a series of alternative options are investigated, and the 9-points prescription is selected 
as the most suitable one according to the validation procedure described in Sec.~\ref{sec:validation}.
In this Appendix we present an alternative simpler choice for the 9-point prescription, denoted as 3-points prescription,
studying how the fit and validation results change, and showing how the 9-points prescription is indeed a better option. 

%
In the three point prescription both the renormalization and factorization scales are varied coherently by a fixed amount about the
central value.
In other words, considering a single process we set $k_f=k_r$ and we only vary the single resulting scale, obtaining the
2+1 points in the scales space shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3-points}.

      \label{fig:3-points}
    \end{caption}
\end{figure}
The resulting entries for the theory covariance matrix are 
\begin{align}
    \label{3S}
    S^{(\rm 3pt)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\big\{ \Delta_i^{++}\Delta_j^{++}  + \Delta_i^{--}\Delta_j^{--}\big\} \, ,
\end{align}
whenever $i,j$ are point belonging to the same process $\pi$.
Considering two different processes $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ we set $k_f=k_{r_1}$ for $\pi_1$ and $k_f=k_{r_1}$ for $\pi_2$
and then vary $k_{r_1}$ and $k_{r_2}$ independently. Note that in this way the correlation in the variation of $k_f$
between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ is necessarily ignored so that the variations for each process are entirely uncorrelated.
Eq.~\eqref{3S} is generalized to the off-diagonal entries of the theory covariance matrix getting
\begin{equation}
    S^{(\rm 3pt)}_{i_1j_2} = 
    \frac{1}{4}\big\{\big(\Delta_{i_1}^{++} + \Delta_{i_1}^{--} \big) \big(\Delta_{j_2}^{++} + \Delta_{j_2}^{--} \big) \big\}\, .
\end{equation}
The validation of such covariance matrix proceeds like described in Sec.~\ref{sec:validation},
through the computation of the angle $\theta$ between the shift $\delta$ and its component on
subspace $S$, defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:angle}. In Table ~\ref{tab:process_efficiencies} 
we compare the values of such angle for each process in the case of the 3- and 9-points prescriptions:
the former performs rather poorly in comparison to the 9-points one, showing how a too
simple covariance matrix doesn't capture the pattern of correlation between theory uncertainties. 
This suggests that lack of correlation in the factorization scale between processes in this prescription
means that much of the correlation in the MHOU due to universal PDF evolution has been missed.

In Table.~\ref{tab:chi_3_vs_9} we report the values for the total $\chi^2$ and $\phi$ estimator for fits performed with the 9-points,
already commented in Sec.~\ref{sec:th_error_results} and reported here for reference, and the 3-points
prescription, together with values for the baseline NLO fit produced without any theory error.
In the case of the 3-points prescription the quality of the fit remains unchanged by the inclusion of the MHOU,
while as noticed before it is improved when considering the 9-point prescription, for which we also observe a more 
marked increase in the value of $\phi$.

Finally in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdfs_plots_th_err_3_vs_9} we study the dependence of the fits results on the choice of the prescription
for the theory covariance matrix, looking at the gluon distribution. In the same plot we report also the central value of
the NNLO fit with experimental uncertainties only. All distributions are normalized to the 3-points prescription results.
In general the two results are consistent, but the central value of the 9-points prescription result is much closer 
to the NNLO central value, providing further confirmation for preferring the 9-point prescription.
