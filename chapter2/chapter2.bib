abstract = "A novel derivation of the Q2 dependence of quark and gluon densities (of given helicity) as predicted by quantum chromodynamics is presented. The main body of predictions of the theory for deep-inleastic scattering on either unpolarized or polarized targets is re-obtained by a method which only makes use of the simplest tree diagrams and is entirely phrased in parton language with no reference to the conventional operator formalism."
