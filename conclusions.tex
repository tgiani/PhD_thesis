\chapter{Summary}
\label{ch:conclusions}
In this thesis we have presented a number of studies connected to the general topic of the Parton Distribution Functions
of the proton.
PDFs represent an essential input to do computations of processes involving hadrons in collider physics, and nowadays
they are responsible for the dominant source of theoretical uncertainties in many important analyses.
In order to achieve better accuracy in theoretical predictions entering phenomenological studies 
a better control of PDFs uncertainties is therefore necessary. This can be achieved through both
improving the numerical frameworks and techniques commonly used to extract PDFs from experimental data, 
and exploring new approaches and physical ideas.
