Most of the research presented in this thesis has been done in collaboration with other colleagues,
as detailed in the following.
The results presented in Chapters~\ref{ch:nnpdf_methodology} and \ref{ch:th_error}
have been produced within the NNPDF collaboration. The original publications are

  of parton distributions with theoretical uncertainties}},  {\em Eur. Phys.
  J.} {\bf C} (2019) 79:838, [\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04311}{{\tt

Chapter~\ref{ch:scalar_model} is based on

Chapter~\ref{ch:qpdfNNPDF} is based on

  data: the nonsinglet case}},  {\em JHEP} {\bf 10} (2019) 137,

in collaboration with Krzysztof Cichy and Luigi Del Debbio.

Finally Chapter~\ref{ch:ppdf_NNPDF} is based on

L.~Del~Debbio, T.~Giani, J.~Karpie, K.~Orginos, A.~Radyushkin, and
  S.~Zafeiropoulos, {\it {Neural-network analysis of Parton Distribution
  Functions from Ioffe-time pseudodistributions}},

\comment{to be updated with the final one}

in collaboration with Luigi Del Debbio, Joseph Karpie, Kostas Orginos, Anatoly
Radyushkinc and Savvas Zafeiropoulos.

When results are presented I tried to report more details where I believe that I have played a major role,
reporting additional results when it is necessary for the general understanding of the discussion. 

Unless specified in the caption, I have produced all the figures reported in this thesis.
