Most of the research presented in this thesis has been done in collaboration with other colleagues.
In particular, the results presented in Chapters~\ref{ch:nnpdf_methodology} and \ref{ch:th_error}
have been produced within the NNPDF collaboration. The original publications are

NNPDF Collaboration, R.~Abdul~Khalek et~al., {\it {A first determination
  of parton distributions with theoretical uncertainties}},  {\em Eur. Phys.
  J.} {\bf C} (2019) 79:838, [\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04311}{{\tt
  arXiv:1905.04311}}]

Those reported in Chapter~\ref{ch:jets} are based on 

R.~Abdul~Khalek et~al., {\it {Phenomenology of NNLO jet production at the LHC
  and its impact on parton distributions}},  {\em Eur. Phys. J. C} {\bf 80}
  (2020), no.~8 797, [\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11327}{{\tt

Chapter~\ref{ch:bottom} is based on

S.~Forte, T.~Giani, and D.~Napoletano, {\it {Fitting the b-quark PDF as a
  massive-b scheme: Higgs production in bottom fusion}},  {\em Eur. Phys. J. C}
  {\bf 79} (2019), no.~7 609, [\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02207}{{\tt

and finally Chapters~\ref{ch:scalar_model},~\ref{ch:qpdfNNPDF} and~\ref{ch:ppdf_NNPDF} are based on

\comment{to be updated with the final one}

When results are presented I tried to report more details where I believe that I have played a major role,
reporting additional results when it is necessary for the general understanding of the discussion. 

Unless specified in the caption, I have produced all the figures reported in this thesis.
