\chapter*{Lay Summary}
In this thesis we present a number of studies concerning the determination of the
Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton. 
PDFs describe the internal structure of the nucleons in terms of their constituent
quarks and gluons, and therefore they are important to gain a better understanding 
of the fundamental structure of the proton.
Additionally PDFs are a necessary input to perform a number of relevant computations
in high energy-physics phenomenology, which makes
their precise knowledge, together with the determination of the corresponding uncertainty,
a key ingredient for new physics studies. 
It is therefore important to produce more and more precise PDFs,
researching into new numerical frameworks and physical ideas. 
In this thesis we present a number of steps in this direction, addressing a number of different topics,
which span from the impact of new experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
to recent developments from the lattice community.
