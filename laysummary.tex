\chapter*{Lay Summary}
In this thesis we present a number of studies concerning the determination of the
Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton. These results are important to gain a better understanding 
of the fundamental structure of the proton and are necessary to perform a number of relevant computations
in high energy-physics phenomenology.
Additionally, a precise knowledge of PDFs is likely to be a key ingredients for new physics studies. 
It is therefore important to produce more and more precise PDFs,
researching into new numerical frameworks and physical ideas. 
In this thesis we present a number of steps in this direction, addressing a number of different topics,
which span from the inclusion of new experimental data to recent developments from the lattice community.
