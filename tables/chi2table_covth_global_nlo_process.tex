\caption{The values of the $\chi^2/N_{\rm dat}$ 
  in the NNPDF3.1 global fits with the theory covariance matrix $S$, compared to the results based on including only
  the experimental covariance matrix $C$. We also show  results obtained
  including the theory covariance matrix only in the $\chi^2$ definition but not
  in the data generation and conversely.
  Values corresponding to the NNLO fit with  experimental covariance matrix $C$ only are also shown.
